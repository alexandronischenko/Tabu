## Preparation for the game
The players are divided into two teams:  
 one team is called team A and the other is called team B.  
 502 cards are placed in the card holder. It is the turn of the player from team A. The hint player takes a card containing 5 taboo words, that is, words that cannot be named when explaining just one word written on the card.  
  The game continues until the time runs out.  
Each time a teammate successfully guesses a keyword, a new card is placed on top of the old one, and each card in that pile represents one point for Team A. In the event that a player from the first team says the word “taboo,” a point is awarded to the second team. There comes a change of teams.
